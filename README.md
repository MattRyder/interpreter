Interpreter
===========

This is a Ruby interpreter, written in C for the good part, with help from Lex and Bison.
Requires Flex, Bison and Clang, unless you want to change it to something like GCC.

It's based on MRI, as seen in the Node structure, and a bit of inspiration in the general format.

No actual licence applied, as (I believe) this is owned by Staffordshire University. I'm not too sure on that, so clone at your own risk. Intellectual property law is a trifle hard for this programmer.

Prerequisites
=============

* Flex
* GNU Bison
* llvm-clang
